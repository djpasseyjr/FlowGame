# Flow (A Game)

Water plants until they grow. Don't water them too much or the fungi will grow.

The point of this was to showcase how a game could be a testbed for understanding why complex systems are so hard for us. Feedback, time delays, nonlinearity etc. make it hard to intervene appropriately.

There is some decent code here, but my pygame animation skills are weak and leave something to be desired. The game is runnable. Use the following:

```
python3 -m flow_py
```
# FlowGame
