# FlowGame (A Game)

![flowers that you can grow in the game](https://github.com/djpasseyjr/FlowGame/raw/main/images/screenshot.png)

Water plants until they grow. Don't water them too much or the fungi will grow.

## Why does this exist?

The point of this was to showcase how a game could be a testbed for understanding why complex systems are so hard for us. Feedback, time delays, nonlinearity etc. make it hard to intervene appropriately.

There is some decent code here, but my pygame animation skills leave something to be desired.

## Can I try it?

You can. The game is barely runnable. Use the following:

```
python3 -m flow_py
```
